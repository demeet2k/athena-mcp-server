# Water Replay And Recovery

## Recovery law

The Water lift is only legal if it can return to the current 4D witnesses without losing corridor truth, appendix legality, or replay closure.

The recovery zero point is `Z_water.replay`.

## Recovery routes

## Recovery constraint

If the live Google Docs gate remains blocked, Water recovery stays in local-authority mode. No route in this package is allowed to upgrade its truth state by guessing at unseen live-docs content.
