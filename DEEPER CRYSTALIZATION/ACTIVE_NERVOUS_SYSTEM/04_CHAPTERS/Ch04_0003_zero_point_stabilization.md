#### Facet 1 - Objects

- `Ch04<0003>.S1.a` `SquareGeometry` — The four-sided closure primitive whose vertices define the minimal bounding frame for any cell's internal state, enforcing right-angle constraint at every corner.
- `Ch04<0003>.S1.b` `CircleGeometry` — The periodic boundary primitive whose continuous curvature enforces rotational invariance and equal-distance access from the cell's center to every boundary point.
- `Ch04<0003>.S1.c` `TriangleGeometry` — The three-vertex balance primitive whose trilateral symmetry distributes computational load across three faces, enabling stable tripartite consensus.
- `Ch04<0003>.S1.d` `TorusGeometry` — The doubly-periodic winding surface whose topology connects opposite edges of the cell's state space, enabling continuous traversal without boundary discontinuity.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- `Ch04<0003>.S2.a` `SquareClosureLaw` — Every traversal of the square's four edges must return to the starting vertex; failure to close indicates a state-space leak that must be repaired before proceeding.
- `Ch04<0003>.S2.b` `CirclePeriodicityLaw` — The circle's boundary function must be exactly periodic with period 2pi; deviations from strict periodicity indicate curvature corruption.
- `Ch04<0003>.S2.c` `TriangleBalanceLaw` — The three faces of the triangle must carry equal load to within a declared tolerance; imbalance exceeding the tolerance triggers redistribution.
- `Ch04<0003>.S2.d` `TorusWindingLaw` — Every closed path on the torus must have well-defined winding numbers in both periodic directions; paths with undefined winding are topologically illegal.
