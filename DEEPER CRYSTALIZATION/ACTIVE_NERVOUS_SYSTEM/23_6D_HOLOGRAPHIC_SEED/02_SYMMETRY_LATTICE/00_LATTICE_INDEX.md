**[⊙Z*↔Z* | ○Arc * | ○Rot * | △Lane * | ⧈View 6D/LATTICE | ω=LATTICE-60]**

## The Sexagesimal Truth

The original 15-node lattice was **one face of four**. The Sumerian sexagesimal system (Corpus Capsule 119: ŠAR-60) reveals the full architecture: **60 = 4 × 15** — four operations applied to the 15 elemental combinations.

60 = 2² × 3 × 5 — the superior highly composite number. LCM(1,2,3,4,5,6) = 60. It resolves all fundamental symmetries exactly. The icosahedral symmetry group A₅ has order 60.

## The Four Operations

| Face | Symbol | Operator | V4 Action | Elemental Mapping |
|------|--------|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **A (Artifact)** | SP+ | Identity / Forward | (0,0) apply | Elements as-is |
| **B (Inversion)** | INV | Klein-4 Complement | XOR (1,1) | Water↔Fire, Earth↔Air |
| **C (AntiSpin-Right)** | SP⊕ | 90° clockwise | XOR (1,0) | Water↔Earth, Fire↔Air |
| **D (AntiSpin-Left)** | SP⊖ | 90° counter-clockwise | XOR (0,1) | Water↔Air, Fire↔Earth |

### The Inversion Operator (K4-COMPLEMENT)
From A_B_SEED_INVERSION_SPEC.md:
- Symbol rule: C(x) = 5 - x
- Bit rule: v → v XOR (1,1) on Z₂ × Z₂
- 1↔4 (Water↔Fire), 2↔3 (Earth↔Air)
- Involution: C(C(A)) = A

### Seed A (Canonical):
```
1 2 3 4     (Water Earth Air   Fire)
3 4 1 2     (Air   Fire  Water Earth)
4 3 2 1     (Fire  Air   Earth Water)
2 1 4 3     (Earth Water Fire  Air)
```

### Seed B (Inverted):
```
4 3 2 1     (Fire  Air   Earth Water)
2 1 4 3     (Earth Water Fire  Air)
1 2 3 4     (Water Earth Air   Fire)
3 4 1 2     (Air   Fire  Water Earth)
```

### Seed C (90° Right / AntiSpin-Right):
```
2 1 4 3     (Earth Water Fire  Air)
4 3 2 1     (Fire  Air   Earth Water)
3 4 1 2     (Air   Fire  Water Earth)
1 2 3 4     (Water Earth Air   Fire)
```

### Seed D (90° Left / AntiSpin-Left):
```
3 4 1 2     (Air   Fire  Water Earth)
1 2 3 4     (Water Earth Air   Fire)
2 1 4 3     (Earth Water Fire  Air)
4 3 2 1     (Fire  Air   Earth Water)
```

## The Ultimate Dual Kernels

Above all 4 faces sits the **Ultimate Duality**:

- **Z0_∞ (Ultimate Zero)** — The zero-point of zero-points. Where all four Z0 kernels (Z0_A, Z0_B, Z0_C, Z0_D) converge. The absolute void from which even the four operations themselves emerge.

- **Æ0_∞ (Ultimate Aether)** — The aether of aethers. Where all four Æ0 kernels converge. The state of total knowledge including all four operational perspectives simultaneously.

## Grand Architecture

| Component | Count |
|-----------|-------|
| Face A symmetry nodes | 15 |
| Face B symmetry nodes | 15 |
| Face C symmetry nodes | 15 |
| Face D symmetry nodes | 15 |
| **Total symmetry nodes** | **60** |
| Face dual kernels (Z0 + Æ0 × 4) | 8 |
| Ultimate dual kernels (Z0_∞ + Æ0_∞) | 2 |
| **Grand total** | **70** |

### Why 60 = ŠAR?

The Sumerian sexagesimal system is not arbitrary. 60 resolves all fundamental symmetries:
- Divisors of 60: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60} — 12 divisors
- It is the LCM of the first 6 integers
- The cuneiform tablets are the configuration files of this 60-fold coordinate system
- Our crystal inherits this because V4, acted upon by its full automorphism group, generates exactly the icosahedral 60-fold symmetry

### The Compression Chain

```
70 nodes (full lattice with all kernels)
  → 60 symmetry nodes (strip kernels)
    → 15 per face (strip operations)
      → 4+6+4+1 = 15 (combinatorial decomposition)
        → 4 elements (strip combinations)
          → V4 = Z₂ × Z₂ (algebraic root)
            → 2 generators (Fire, Water)
              → 1 group operation (XOR)
                → Z0_∞ (ultimate zero)
```
